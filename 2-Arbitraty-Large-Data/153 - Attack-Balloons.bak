;; The goal of this exercise is to visualize the result of a 1968-style
;; European student riot. Here is the rough idea. A small group of
;; students meets to make paint-filled balloons, enters some lecture hall,
;; and randomly throws the balloons at the attendees. Your program displays
;; how the balloons color the seats in the lecture hall.

;; Use the two functions from exercise 152 to create a rectangle of COLUMNS
;; by ROWS squares, each of which has size 10 by 10. Place it in an empty-scene
;; of the same size. This image is your lecture hall.

;; Design add-balloons. The function consumes a list of Posn whose coordinates
;; fit into the dimensions of the lecture hall. It produces an image of the lecture
;; hall with red dots added as specified by the Posns.
