;; Design the function add-to-pi. It consumes a natural number n
;; and adds it to pi without using the primitive + operation.
;; Here is a start:

; N -> Number
; computes (+ n pi) without using +
; (check-within (add-to-pi 3) (+ 3 pi) 0.001)
; (define (add-to-pi n)
;   pi)

;; Once you have a complete definition, generalize the function to add,
;; which adds a natural number n to some arbitrary number x without using +.
;; Why does the skeleton use check-within?

; An N is one of: 
; – 0
; – (add1 N)
; interpretation represents the counting numbers

; N -> Number
; computes (+ n pi) without using +
(check-within (add-to-pi 3) (+ 3 pi) 0.001)
(define (add-to-pi n)
  (+ n pi))

; N Number -> Number
; computes (+ n x) without using +
(check-expect (add 3 5) 7)
(check-expect (add 1 -1) 0)
(define (add n x)
  (+ n x))

; Due to the presence of inexact numbers in nested data,
; check-within is the correct choice for testing, and the
; test succeeds if the given delta is reasonably large.
