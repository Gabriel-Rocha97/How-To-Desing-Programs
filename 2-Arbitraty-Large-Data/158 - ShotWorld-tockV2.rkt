;; If you run main, press the space bar (fire a shot), and wait for a goodly amount of time,
;; the shot disappears from the canvas. When you shut down the world canvas, however,
;; the result is a world that still contains this invisible shot.

;; Design an alternative tock function that doesnâ€™t just move shots one pixel per clock tick
;; but also eliminates those whose coordinates place them above the canvas. Hint You may wish
;; to consider the design of an auxiliary function for the recursive cond clause.

; A ShotWorld is List-of-numbers. 
; interpretation each number on such a list
;   represents the y-coordinate of a shot
