; Develop a data representation for the following four kinds of zoo animals:

; Design the fits? function, which consumes a zoo animal and a description of a cage.
; It determines whether the cageâ€™s volume is large enough for the animal.


; A Zanimal represent a animal on a zoo
; The Zanimal are:
(define-struct spider [legs space])
; Spiders is (make-spider Number Number)
; (make-spiders l s) represeent a spider with l legs remaning
; and s space for cage
(define-struct elephant [space weight])
; Elephants is (make-elehphant Number Number)
; (make-elephant s w) represent the s elephant space required
; for cage the elephant and its w weight. 
(define-struct armadilo [space species])
; Armadilho is (make-armadilo Number String)
; (make-armadilho s n) represent a armadilo s space for cage
; and its n species


(define-struct cage [width depth heigth])
; A Cage is (make-cage Number Number Number)
; interpretation (make-cage x y z) is the cage measurements.
; x is the width, y the depth and z the height.
