; Develop the function checked-make-vec, which is to be understood
; as a checked version of the primitive operation make-vec. It ensures
; that the arguments to make-vec are positive numbers. In other words,
; checked-make-vec enforces our informal data definition.

(define-struct vec [x y])
; A vec is
;   (make-vec PositiveNumber PositiveNumber)
; interpretation represents a velocity vector

; Any -> VEC
; verify if the arguments of vec are following its data definition
(define (checked-make-vec v)
