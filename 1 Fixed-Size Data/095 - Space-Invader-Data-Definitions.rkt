; A UFO is a Posn.

(define-struct tank [loc vel])
; A Tank is a structure:
;   (make-tank Number Number). 
; interpretation (make-tank x dx) specifies the position:
; (x, HEIGHT) and the tank's speed: dx pixels/tick 
 
; A Missile is a Posn. 
; interpretation (make-posn x y) is the missile's place

(define-struct aim [ufo tank])
(define-struct fired [ufo tank missile])
; A SIGS is one of: 
; – (make-aim UFO Tank)
; – (make-fired UFO Tank Missile)
; interpretation represents the complete state of a 
; space invader game

; e.x describes the tank maneuvering into position to fire
; the missile:
; (make-aim (make-posn 20 10) (make-tank 28 -3))
; the struct is create combine aim-ufo, a posn describe the
; x and y location of the UFO, and aim-tank, witch describes the
; tank's position and velocity

; e.x missile has been fired:
; (make-fired (make-posn 20 10)
;            (make-tank 28 -3)
;            (make-posn 28 (- HEIGHT TANK-HEIGHT)))

; e.x the missle will colide the UFO
; (make-fired (make-posn 20 10)
;             (maketank 28 -3)
;             (make-missile 22 13)
