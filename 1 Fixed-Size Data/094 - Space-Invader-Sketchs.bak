; Draw some sketches of what the game scenery looks like
; at various stages. Use the sketches to determine the constant
; and the variable pieces of the game. For the former, develop
; physical and graphical constants that describe the dimensions
; of the world (canvas) and its objects. Also develop some background
; scenery. Finally, create your initial scene from the constants for the
; tank, the UFO, and the background.
